Hi Staff and people trying to break our code:

speck.h and speck.cc contain the definition and implementation of our SPECK cipher library.
The included makefile makes specktest.out and speckutil.out.
specktest.out is a simple test file that tests the published test vector for SPECK 128/128, and  all the other library functions.
speckutil.out is a helper program that performs common operations using the SPECK cipher. See speckutil.readme for more information on how the program works.
