Each sheet contains a table of results and an accompanying graph for varying block sizes with fixed key sizes.
Key sizes were fixed at 256-, 128-, and 64-bits for each trial. 
Three trials of each different block size were conducted, and the average of the three trials was taken as final data.
Both encryption and decryption were tested with the three discrete key sizes.

The results showed that the runtimes were constant despite varying block sizes (upto 128-bits) and key sizes (upto 256-bits), 
thereby indicating that neither the block sizes nor key sizes impacted the running time.
