RSA - Variable Prime Count

PRIME_COUNT is located in rsa.h, to change the number of primes used change this value
Default is Triple Prime RSA - per requirement by the spec

To generate keys create a main function which calls rsa_key_gen( bitLength )
Public and private information will be printed to standard out

These values can be parsed in or simply copy + pasted into strings to be used
in encryption decryption schemes (as seen in the current main.cpp)

Otherwise there are essentially only two functions

rsa_encrypt( message, exponent, prime list )
rsa_decrypt( message, exponent, modulus )

encryption is handled with montgomery multiplication by squaring
decryption is handled with the chinese remainder theorem and montgomery multiplication

ENJOY THE BEAUTY OF RSA!
