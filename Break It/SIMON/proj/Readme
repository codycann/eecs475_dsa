 ----------------- simon Readme------------------------
 General info:
 Perform random key generation , encryption and decryption of Simon in Electronic codebook mode
 in three individual functions.
 

 All coding in C++.
 C++11 <random> library included.
 May complie and run with terminal commands:
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp simon.cpp uberzahl.cpp -o simon 
 ./simon

 ------------------ Random key generator (keygen)--------------------
 vector<uberzahl> keygen(int n = 64, int m = 4);
 Generate a random key with size n * m;

	

 Parameters: n, the Word size, with default value n = 64; 
 m, the Key Words, with default value m = 4;
 Hence the total length of the key will be n * m.

 Requires: n and m must corresponding to a pair of feasible value in simon cipher,
 see details in the reference.
 Error message will be put forward by static errorchecking functions.
 
 Return value: Return key into a vector of size m with each length n;
 where each key has an acutual length (start from left most non zero bit)
 of n >= acutal_length > n-8.
 



----------------Encrypt and Decrypt function-------------------------
 vector<uberzahl> encrypt(vector<uberzahl> key, vector<uberzahl> plaintext);
 vector<uberzahl> decrypt(vector<uberzahl> key, vector<uberzahl> ciphertext);
 Using the given key, perform the encryption/decription of simon cipher in ECB mode.

 Parameter: vec<>key: m key blocks with each length n form a total length of n * m;
 where n is the Word size; and m is the Words per key; 
 vec<>plain/ciphertext: text blocks with each length corresponding to 2 * n.
 Thus all inputing cipher blocks' length must corresponding to the inputing key word size.

 Require: The acutual length (start from left most non zero bit)
 of the first block of key (which is the first element of the input vector)  
 should be n >= acutal_length > n-8. Otherwise the automatic value detect of n WILL CRASH.
 Error message will be put forward by static errorchecking functions.

 Return value: Returns the vector of blocks of encrypted text(cipher text)/ decrypted
 text(plaintext).

 if you are the guy who need to break this, hahaha, good luck.
